# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## The Silver Tsunami

<br>

### Overview
* <p> The purpose of this analysis was to be able to see how many employees were retiring, and how to make sure that there would be an easily transition between a new wave of employees and The Silver Tsunami. </p>

### Results
* It appears that the majority of employees that will need to be replaced are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Which is un surprising, but also a signifcant challenge as these employees are crucial. 
* However, with so few managers and assistent engineers retiring it implies that those positions are ready to be promoted, so we might only have to replace those lower level employees.
* There is a total of 90,398 employees retiring 
* There are 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. 
  
### Summary
* With the "Silver Tsunami" Incoming, it appears as though there will be 90,398 employees that will need to be replaced.
